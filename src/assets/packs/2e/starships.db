The Dominion War reduced the number of hulls constructed, but the end of the war&mdash;and the return of U.S.S. Voyager in 2378&mdash;meant renewed passion for this spaceframe. Many Intrepid-class vessels remain in active service well into the 25th century.</p>\n<p>CAPABILITIES: The Intrepid class was designed around being as efficient in its warp field geometry as possible, while also allowing for rapid transit of turbulent space-time. The vessel also has variable geometry warp nacelles that allow fine adjustment to the warp field, improving warp stability, allowing high sustained warp speeds, and granting an impressive maximum emergency speed of warp 9.975. Intrepid-class vessels were the first to have bioneural computer components installed to augment the advanced isolinear computer core. These bioneural systems allowed the ship to &ldquo;learn&rdquo; as it formed data connections in a more efficient way than standard isolinear indexing.</p>\n<p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: Refits for the Intrepid class focused on improving and expanding the sensor platforms.</p>\n<p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Pathfinder and Reconnaissance Operations, Scientific and Survey Operations, Technical Testbed.</p>\n<p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Intrepid-class vessels take names from mythology and space exploration across the Federation.

Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards began to develop a new deep-space exploration cruiser that would address these concerns. The Ambassador class was developed and launched, and many of the engineering techniques, design ideas, and technologies created would be refined and become the basis for the Galaxy class.</p>\n<p>CAPABILITIES: The Ambassador class was designed in a similar way to previous Starfleet cruisers, with a saucer-shaped primary hull and a cylindrical secondary engineering hull. The most obvious difference is the then-unique warp nacelles containing high-efficiency warp coils with directional subspace buffers. The Ambassador class was wildly successful, but also a victim of its own innovation. Research and development continued on the ground-breaking systems, improving them faster than they could be installed, and it became apparent the Ambassador class wasn&rsquo;t able to keep up with technological development. Production was halted on further spaceframes, replacing newer construction with the Galaxy class beginning in the 2360s.</p>\n<p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: Two separate refit programs were used. The Enterprise program improved the vessel&rsquo;s subspace communication and sensor platforms. The Pollux program was dedicated to improving the vessel&rsquo;s weapon systems and warp drive.</p>\n<p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Multirole Explorer, Scientific and Survey Operations, Strategic and Diplomatic Operations.</p>\n<p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Ambassador-class vessels are often named after important ambassadors and peacemakers, great battles and ships of the past, or hopeful ideas for the future.

Through two wars, the Galor and her sister classes were the backbone of the Cardassian Central Command.</p>\n<p>CAPABILITIES: Simplicity, ease of maintenance and construction, and having as small of a logistics need as possible were all important when the Galor was designed.

Instead, this class utilized two separate energy weapon systems: phaser arrays spread across the outer hull and a heavy forward mounted disruptor emitter.</p>\n<p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: Central Command issued orders after the class came into service to improve the weapon systems with any captured technology.

After a total redesign was performed on nearly all ship&rsquo;s systems, the transwarp propulsion was replaced with standard warp propulsion. The versatile Excelsior spaceframe became a standard sight across the Federation and beyond, and it continued to be manufactured into the 2390s.</p>\n<p>CAPABILITIES: Originally intended for the large transwarp coils, the spaceframe&rsquo;s nacelles provided ample room for extra standard coils that allowed the class to have some of the highest sustained warp speeds for a ship of its size. Stemming from the initial high-power needs for the transwarp system, the spaceframe had nearly double the amount of fusion reactors required for secondary power systems and the impulse drive. These same reactors provide extra power to the ship&rsquo;s defensive shielding. The Excelsior also had two dedicated shuttlebays, the main shuttlebay and a lower bay on the underside of the secondary hull used for cargo transport and storage.</p>\n<p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: A single variant built at San Francisco Shipyards spread across the Federation. While visually similar to the standard spaceframe, the saucer section of the vessel contained double the number of fusion reactors and added two additional impulse drive units.

Galaxy class vessels were also the first that could separate and re-dock their primary hull to the engineering hull without the assistance of a drydock or support vessels. This meant Galaxy-class vessels could split their focus efficiently, or put civilians and dependents out of harm&rsquo;s way in hostile situations.</p>\n<p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: During the Dominion War, Galaxy-class vessels nearing completion were repurposed as command-and-control vessels for rear admirals to use in fleet actions.</p>\n<p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Strategic and Diplomatic Operations, Scientific and Survey Operations, Multirole Explorer.</p>\n<p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Galaxy-class vessels take their names from many different cultures across the Federation.

The vast range of societies and species it encountered meant the Alliance, while heavily centralized in the Ferenginar system, had to maintain the ever-growing trade lanes as well as ensure the markets would stay linked to the homeworld, through free trade or by force. The Ferengi Congress of Economic Advisors levied a tax on all non-Ferengi economic activity to begin construction of the D’Kora-class marauder. Ferenginar had no active force like Starfleet, but the Congress would provide a letter of marque to any free trader willing to captain and crew a vessel for the good of the Alliance. D’Kora marauders quickly became a symbol of the Ferengi Alliance across the Alpha and Beta Quadrants, feared for their weaponry and the economic exploitation that would occur in their presence.</p>\n<p>CAPABILITIES: The D’Kora needed a large amount of its internal volume as mission adaptable space, but the vast majority of commanding officers used this space as cargo storage.

Many of the earliest vessels of the class had their construction accelerated by repurposing many components from vessels which had suffered catastrophic damage or were otherwise being decommissioned. The overall design of the Constitution III-class, however, owes more to a different legacy. Often referred to as the Neo-Constitution, the design resembles the Constitution-class ships of the 23rd century, particularly the refit (or Constitution II) design which entered service in 2270.</p>\n<p>CAPABILITIES: Constitution III-class ships are built to function as versatile exploratory craft, able to fulfil a wide range of mission objectives. The design and construction coincided with new developments in propulsion technology, which were integrated into the project development; the result is a class with the highest Impulse power-to-geometry ratio in the fleet, and a top speed of warp 9.99. This makes it ideal for rapidly responding to emergencies and changing circumstances in densely populated regions.</p>\n<p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: The class is often regarded more as a refit project than a dedicated class, blurring the line between creating a new ship and rebuilding an existing one.</p>\n<p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Multirole Explorer, Strategic and Diplomatic Operations, Crisis and Emergency Response</p>\n<p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: Constitution III-class vessels are mostly named after previous Starfleet vessels, often the ones which contributed components to the new design, such as the Titan.</p>","crew":{"value":0,"max":5},"departmentorder":["command","conn","security","engineering","science","medicine"],"departments":{"command":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.department.command","value":"0","selected":true},"conn":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.department.conn","value":"1","selected":false},"engineering":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.department.engineering","value":"1","selected":false},"medicine":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.department.medicine","value":"0","selected":false},"science":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.department.science","value":"1","selected":false},"security":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.department.security","value":"0","selected":false}},"designation":"","missionprofile":"","power":{"value":0,"max":null},"refit":"","resistance":5,"scale":5,"shields":{"value":0,"max":15},"shieldmod":0,"crwmod":0,"reservepower":true,"shaken":false,"servicedate":"2396","spaceframe":"Constitution III","systems":{"communications":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.system.communications","value":9,"selected":true,"breaches":0},"computers":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.system.computers","value":10,"selected":false,"breaches":0},"engines":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.system.engines","value":11,"selected":false,"breaches":0},"sensors":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.system.sensors","value":10,"selected":false,"breaches":0},"structure":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.system.structure","value":10,"selected":false,"breaches":0},"weapons":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.system.weapons","value":10,"selected":false,"breaches":0}},"traits":"Federation Starship, Constitution III class, Legacy Components"},"prototypeToken":{"name":"Constitution III","displayName":50,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"texture":{"src":"systems/sta/assets/compendia/ships/starfleet/constitution-token.webp","offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"rotation":0,"tint":"#ffffff"},"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"sight":{"enabled":false,"range":0,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"brightness":0,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[],"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"folder":"ArdOhBErBI1lc5F7","name":"Tractor Beam (Strength 4)","type":"item","_id":"ul3gi4GIOCQkmvmy","img":"systems/sta/assets/compendia/icons/starshipweapons-core/weapon-tractor-beam.svg","system":{"description":"<p>The Strength of the tractor beam is equal to the ship&rsquo;s Scale minus 1.

Using ideas gleaned from the Klingon Empire&rsquo;s trade of D7s in the late 2260s and further native technological advances, the Empire produced the D&rsquo;Deridex class warbird beginning in 2350. The D&rsquo;Deridex was successful enough that the Empire continued to produce it until the shipyards capable of building them were destroyed in the Romulan supernova.</p>\n<p>CAPABILITIES: The massive spaceframe utilizes two different types of warp coil design. At each side standard warp nacelles and coils produce the warp field, but monopolar subspace field generators installed across the dorsal and ventral &lsquo;wings&rsquo; of the vessel provide stability while at high warp velocities. This class is the first vessel of its size to be powered by an artificial quantum singularity, essentially a subspace compressed mass replicating a black hole on a small scale. The immense amount of power this can produce is augmented by standard fusion reactors and allows the ship to move at speeds of warp 9.6, and warp 6 even while under cloak.</p>\n<p>REFITS AND VARIANTS: Refits leading into the Dominion War saw improvements to weapon and sensor systems. Plans for improving the quantum singularity reactor were begun in the 2380s but halted with the destruction of the Romulan star system.</p>\n<p>SUGGESTED MISSION PROFILES: Battlecruiser, Multirole Explorer, Espionage/Intelligence, Tactical Operations, Technical Testbed.</p>\n<p>NAMING CONVENTIONS: D&rsquo;Deridex names include famous starship commanders from Romulan history and important Imperial worlds.</p>","crew":{"value":0,"max":12},"departmentorder":["command","conn","security","engineering","science","medicine"],"departments":{"command":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.department.command","value":"1","selected":true},"conn":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.department.conn","value":"0","selected":false},"engineering":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.department.engineering","value":"1","selected":false},"medicine":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.department.medicine","value":"0","selected":false},"science":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.department.science","value":"0","selected":false},"security":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.department.security","value":"1","selected":false}},"designation":"","missionprofile":"","power":{"value":0,"max":null},"refit":"","resistance":6,"scale":6,"shields":{"value":0,"max":18},"shieldmod":0,"crwmod":0,"reservepower":true,"shaken":false,"servicedate":"2350","spaceframe":"D-Deridex","systems":{"communications":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.system.communications","value":8,"selected":true,"breaches":0},"computers":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.system.computers","value":9,"selected":false,"breaches":0},"engines":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.system.engines","value":10,"selected":false,"breaches":0},"sensors":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.system.sensors","value":10,"selected":false,"breaches":0},"structure":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.system.structure","value":11,"selected":false,"breaches":0},"weapons":{"label":"sta.actor.starship.system.weapons","value":9,"selected":false,"breaches":0}},"traits":"Romulan Starship, D'Deridex class, Imposing"},"prototypeToken":{"name":"D-Deridex","displayName":50,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"texture":{"src":"systems/sta/assets/compendia/ships/romulan/d-deridex-token.webp","offsetX":0,"offsetY":0,"scaleX":1,"scaleY":1,"rotation":0,"tint":"#ffffff"},"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":null},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":360,"bright":0,"color":null,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"attenuation":0.5,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"type":null,"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"sight":{"enabled":false,"range":0,"angle":360,"visionMode":"basic","color":null,"attenuation":0.1,"brightness":0,"saturation":0,"contrast":0},"detectionModes":[],"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"folder":"ArdOhBErBI1lc5F7","name":"Tractor Beam (Strength 5)","type":"item","_id":"rqXHOuPHzSLTEnIw","img":"systems/sta/assets/compendia/icons/starshipweapons-core/weapon-tractor-beam.svg","system":{"description":"<p>The Strength of the tractor beam is equal to the ship&rsquo;s Scale minus 1.
